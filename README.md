# Welcome to RC Projects!

Look in here for open-source flying model setups! 

These utilities allow quick templates to work I've done recently in the RC aircraft realm. I grew up reading books on flight theory since
kindergarten; specifically on how to build aircraft. I've been building fflying models ever seince. I'm a hardware designer and software
developer, so let's use the scinetific method but sharing constants and setups so everyone can join in.

Programs here are good "how-to's" for the setups provided. The scientific method allows repeatability and low-priced micros with easy
software development environments allow cheaper repeatability and more automation.
